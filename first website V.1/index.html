        Welcome to my first attempt at programming a website!
        </h3>
            </div>
        <p>In this website I will be attempting to do as much programming without the help of notes. I will make four separate pages, 
            including this one, displaying a(n): introduction, which you are reading now; my favorite music, my favorite video games, 
            and a page with contact information. This website will serve as the benchmark for my current knowledge in programming, and 
            as a sort-of template for me to build off of and develop into a portfolio piece.</p>

        <p>Going through the education process from intermediate school through highschool I found that I performed best at, and enjoyed: 
            Math, art and band. Later on, when I began to attend CVTech, I also found that I did enjoy Graphic design.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I enjoy doing art, including both illustration and graphic design which are the primary hobbies I indulge in. However, 
            I also row, play trumpet and play video games on occasion.

        <p>When I finish the programming program I am currently taking, I hope to go into a proper graphic design career. Although, along the way I 
            hope to find some success in illustration and coding</p>
