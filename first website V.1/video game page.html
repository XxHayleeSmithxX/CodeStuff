                <h1>My Favorite Games</h1> <br>
            </div>
            <p>This is juat a list of some of my favorite video games (as of this time), and why I enjoy them.</p>
            <hr />

            <ul>
                <li>Hades</li>
                <p>I have always had an interest in Greek mythology, especially more obscure myths. However, it also 
                    is mainly a story revolving around family and the complex aspects of personal connections and 
                    relationships. It also has a stellar soundtrack and satisfying roguelike gameplay.</p>
                <br />

                <li>Mariokart 8 DELUXE</li>
                <p>The longest running game in the series, along with the largest roster of tracks and characters, 
                    constant replayability  and essential gimmicks makes it one of my favorite entries in the series.</p>
                <br />

                <li>Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story (2009)</li>
                <p>One of the first ever games I played during my childhood. Even without the context of the first two games, 
                    I always found myself being drawn back by the humor, characters, environments and artstyle along with 
                    being my favorite implementation of turn-based combat.</p>
                <br />

                <li>Mario & Luigi: Brothership</li>
                <p>As the most recent installment of the franchise I found it an enjoyable experience as a new-ish era of 
                    what is hopefully a true revival of the series. I found myself being genuinely drawn in by the characters 
                    and their relationships along with some wonderful character designs and a decent soundtrack.</p>
                <br />

                <li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</li>
                <p>Plain and simple chill fun, great for casual enjoyment. The fact that the whole series includes exclusive 
                    content for each season is what truly makes the game have its draw over the years.</p>
                <br />

                <li>Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</li>
                <p>A wide, expansive world where you can go almost anywhere. The combat is fun, the game encourages unorthodox 
                    solutions to almost every problem and there is truly no one way to play. The entire world itself is beautiful, 
                    and when it wants to unnerve or or frighten the player, it excels.</p>
                <br />

                <li>Minecraft</li>
                <p>Again, it is pure casual fun, with no one way to play. Personally, I enjoy building, and even with the limitations 
                    given, it never feels like Iâ€™m limited in what I can create. No matter how much time I take away from the game, 
                    I will always come back just to experience my greatest memories from my childhood.</p>
